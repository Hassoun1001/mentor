# Maintenance log

Newest entry first. Every run of the maintenance agent appends one entry —
including runs that change nothing. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
- **Report:** status, issue codes seen
- **Decision:** what was done and why (or why nothing was)
- **Change:** commit(s), files, tests added
- **Watch next:** what the next run should check
```

## 2026-10-13 — Autonomy set up (human)
- **Report:** status OK. H1 champion `auto_eurusd_1h_20261006_115233` live since
  2026-10-06 (58.3% test accuracy vs ~51.8% breakeven); 78 independent H1
  windows at 53.8%, not yet significant. Live calibration 6/30 toward its first
  check. Recurring warning: GDELT rate limiting.
- **Decision:** introduced the self-report, the server auto-deploy with
  refusal/rollback, the pinned honesty gates and this log. Owner chose full
  autonomy with Opus 5.5.
- **Change:** weekly report job (Sat 06:00 UTC) + `/api/v1/health/report`;
  digest now grades only the primary lane against its own breakeven.
- **Watch next:** whether the live champion holds above breakeven as its
  independent sample grows; first live-calibration decision (~late November);
  GDELT rate-limit frequency.
